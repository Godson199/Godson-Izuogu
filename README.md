### [Project 1 Python For Data Science: Project Overview]
In this project, I worked on Data cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualizations on a public utility.                                                                                                                                                            
### [Project 2: Hamoye Stage C: Project Overview](https://github.com/Godson199/stage_c_tag_alng/blob/main/Stage_C_tag_along.ipynb)
* In this project, I worked with datasets from the UCI repository to classify and predict the quality (qascore) of the ecological footprint data for the different countries. This data includes:
* Total and per capita nationalbiocapacity
* The ecological footprint of consumption
* The ecological footprint of production
* The total areas in hectares.

### [Project 3: Energy Efficiency Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Godson199/Hamoye_stage_B/blob/main/Hamoye%20_Internship_Stage_B_Project1.ipynb)
* In this project, I developed a multivariate multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on two output output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load of residential buildings.
